# Guesser-Game
The Guesser Game is a Java-based console application where players guess a computer-selected number within a range. It provides feedback on whether guesses are too high, too low, or correct, and tracks attempts. This project demonstrates Java fundamentals such as control flow, user input handling, and basic algorithms.
